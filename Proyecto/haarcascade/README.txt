(NOTE: I have already installed OpenCV3.x version)
All files should be in this source:
C:/Users/yourUser/opencv/sources/data/haarcascades_cuda/

Is not important haarcascade files are in this place, but is better for organize the information,
if you don't want to put there, just replace this source for the other source where you have this files.
